In this post, we explore a surprising phenomenon in optimization for machine learning: situations where traditional variance reduction techniques fail to provide the expected benefits, while momentum-based methods continue to excel.

## The Promise of Variance Reduction

Variance reduction techniques like SVRG, SAG, and SAGA were designed to reduce the variance of stochastic gradient estimates:

$$g_t = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\nabla f_i(x_t)$$

However, in certain high-dimensional and non-convex settings, these methods can struggle.

## Momentum to the Rescue

Momentum methods update parameters using:

$$v_t = \\beta v_{t-1} + (1-\\beta) g_t$$
$$x_{t+1} = x_t - \\alpha v_t$$

Our analysis shows why momentum can be more robust in challenging optimization landscapes, providing both theoretical justification and empirical evidence.`
