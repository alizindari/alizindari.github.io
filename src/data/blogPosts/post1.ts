Saddle point problems arise naturally in many machine learning applications, particularly in minimax optimization and game theory. Understanding the convergence properties of first-order methods for these problems is crucial for developing efficient algorithms.

## Problem Formulation

Consider the minimax optimization problem:

$$\\min_x \\max_y f(x, y)$$

where $f(x, y)$ is a smooth function that is convex in $x$ and concave in $y$. This formulation appears in many contexts, including adversarial training, robust optimization, and generative adversarial networks.

## Theoretical Analysis

We analyze the convergence rates of various first-order methods including gradient descent-ascent, extragradient methods, and accelerated variants. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of problem structure and algorithm design in achieving optimal convergence rates.

The key challenge in saddle point optimization is that standard gradient methods may not converge, even for bilinear problems. We present conditions under which convergence can be guaranteed and derive explicit convergence rates.`
