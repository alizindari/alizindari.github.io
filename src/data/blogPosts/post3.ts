Local SGD has emerged as a popular method for distributed machine learning, allowing workers to perform multiple local updates before communication. Understanding its theoretical properties is crucial for practical deployment.

## The Local SGD Algorithm

In Local SGD, each worker $i$ performs $H$ local updates:

$$x_{k+1}^{(i)} = x_k^{(i)} - \\eta \\sum_{t=0}^{H-1} \\nabla f_i(x_{k,t}^{(i)})$$

before communicating with other workers. This reduces communication overhead but introduces additional complexity in the convergence analysis.

## Convergence Analysis

We provide new convergence guarantees for Local SGD under heterogeneous data distributions, showing how the choice of local update frequency $H$ affects both convergence rate and final accuracy.

Our analysis reveals the fundamental trade-off between communication efficiency and convergence quality in distributed optimization.`
